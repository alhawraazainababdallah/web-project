            <p class="text">
                I&#8217;m YandereDev! I worked at a video game company for 3 years&sbquo; 
                then left to become a freelance programmer and pursue my dream of becoming an independent game developer. 
                In the past&sbquo; I&#8217;ve worked on 5 console games (for Wii&sbquo; 360&sbquo; and PS3) and 5 mobile games (for Vita and iPhone).

                Unfortunately&sbquo; it&#8217;s not easy to give a meaningful answer to this question&sbquo; 
                since the outcome relies on several factors that are out of my hands. I&#8217;ll explain:
                After I have finished implementing the game&#8217;s first rival&sbquo; "Osana"&sbquo; 
                I will hold a crowdfunding campaign with the intention of raising enough money to pay a team of professionals to help me 
                complete the game. There are several potential outcomes for the crowdfunding campaign:
            </p>
                <ul id="ul" role="list" class="text">
                    <li>
                        If the crowdfunding campaign cannot meet its bare minimum goal&sbquo; Yandere Simulator will have to be completed without professional assistance. 
                        I will be very limited in what I can do&sbquo; so the production values will be low&sbquo; and every rival will feel like a clone of Osana. 
                        The final game will feel nearly identical to the current debug sandbox&sbquo; and it will most likely be released sometime in early 2021.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the crowdfunding campaign can meet its bare minimum goal&sbquo; 
                        I will be able to affored to hire professionals to assist me in completing the game. 
                        Many of the game&#8217;s assets will be improved or replaced (such as the character models)&sbquo; 
                        the overall production values of the game will be much higher&sbquo; and each rival will feel unique. 
                        Because of the additional work that will be done on the game&sbquo; it will most likely be released sometime in late 2021.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the crowdfunding campaign can meet its first "stretch goal"&sbquo;
                        I will be able to hire a professional software engineer to replace me as the game&#8217;s lead programmer.
                        As a result&sbquo; the speed of the game&#8217;s development will increase drastically&sbquo;
                        since the rate of progress won&#8217;t be hindered by my personal availability. 
                        The engineer will most likely improve many aspects of the game&sbquo; as well. In this scenario&sbquo; the game would most likely be
                        released in mid 2021.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the crowdfunding campaign can meet additional "stretch goals"&sbquo; 
                        I will be able to pay professionals to work on the game for a longer amount of time&sbquo; 
                        which would allow the game to have "dream" features such as a female Senpai&sbquo; "1980s Mode"&sbquo; 
                        a mode where the layout of the school can be customized&sbquo; etc. Because of the time required to work on these additional features&sbquo; 
                        the game would most likely be released in early 2022.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p class="text">
                Past this point&sbquo; further funding could pay for more programmers so that various responsibilities could be spread across multiple people instead of held exclusively by one person&sbquo; 
                further increasing the game&#8217;s development speed.
                If the crowdfunding campaign fails&sbquo; there are alternate ways to secure funding for the game.
                 
                It&#8217;s possible that I could raise money from investors (in exchange for promising them a portion of the game&#8217;s profits) or partner with a company (most likely in exchange for ownership of the Yandere Simulator brand). 
                So&sbquo; if the crowdfunding campaign fails&sbquo; it doesn&#8217;t immediately spell doom for the project.
                You can expect all of these numbers and estimates to change as we get closer to the crowdfunding campaign&sbquo; 
                and the amount of time/money/assets required to finish the game becomes more apparent.

            <p class="text">
                Because the game is currently in development&sbquo; it is changing all the time. 
                I am constantly improving the performance and increasing the optimization of the code. Thus&sbquo; the minimum specs are always getting lower.
                It&#8217;s possible to run the game with only 6GB of RAM&sbquo; but it&#8217;s recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM.
                To run the game at over 55 FPS consistently&sbquo; you&#8217;d need at least a i7 5820k processor&sbquo; 
                and at least a GTX 970 graphics card. (The hardware I just named is 6 years old.)
