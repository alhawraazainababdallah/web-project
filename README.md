## Outline

### Game Overview

Yandere Simulator is a stealth action video game developed by YandereDev. The game follows a high school girl named Ayano Aishi, who has developed an obsessive crush on her classmate, Taro Yamada, and is willing to do anything to eliminate anyone who gets in the way of her love. The game features various gameplay mechanics, including stealth, social manipulation, and murder, as Ayano attempts to eliminate her rivals without getting caught by teachers or other students. Each rival has one week to eliminate before their confession. The game has been in development for several years and has been controversial due to its violent and mature themes.

### Website Design 

I have completely revamped and redesigned the **original website** of Yandere Simulator (https://yanderesimulator.com/) to create **my own unique version**.

 I carefully considered the purpose of the website and updated each page accordingly, including the addition of new pages such as a comic page... (check **Website pages** for more additional information)

The entire redesign was crafted using **Figma**, ensuring a professional and polished finished product. Feel free to check out the design by clicking the provided link. (https://www.figma.com/file/W8qfOB1kk3ADOJQQjs6EKN/Yandare-Sim?node-id=0%3A1&t=rtp9w0TaiA7XmZk2-1) (I want to acknowledge that my decision to redesign the website was driven by my own selfish needs)

#### Website Pages

The redesigned website for Yandere Simulator includes several key pages. 

- **The Home Page** features an engaging game view that draws visitors in. 
- **The About Page** provides an in-depth backstory of the developer behind the game. 
- **The Wallpaper Page** showcases various artists' submissions of their artwork of the game, which visitors can view and download.
- **The Characters Page** features information of the characters involved in the story.
- **The News Page** provides regular updates on the latest developments and updates for the game.
- **The Download/Controls Page **allows visitors to download the game and explore its gameplay.
- **The Contact Us Page** visitors have two options to get in touch with the developer. 
- -     The first option is for visitors to provide **feedback or report any bugs** (Get in Touch Page) they may have encountered while       using the game.
  -     The second option is for those interested in **volunteering to fill out a form** (Volunteer Page) and submit their information to     the developer. This page serves as a convenient and accessible way for visitors to connect with the developer and offer their    support or suggestions.
- For those who wish to support the project, **the Donate/Merch Page** or **the support us page** offers options to donate or purchase merchandise. 
- Finally, **the Comic Page provides** a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the story through manga, featuring main characters and their backgrounds.

### Code

**JavaScript** played an integral role in the website redesign. It was used to create a dynamic slideshow on the Home Page, as well as the cards view for the Wallpaper and Characters Pages. This involved creating objects within an array and looping over them to recreate the desired effect. Additionally, some JavaScript was added to the Contact Us Page to enhance its functionality,And have also added some design elements to the Support Us page, such as changing the image color when hovering over it with the mouse.

The parallax effect was achieved using **CSS animation**, adding depth and interactivity to the design.(beside using variables and other CSS functionality).Additionally **CSS animations** were also used to create a fading effect to the slideshow.

Overall, the combination of JavaScript and CSS helped to create a more engaging and dynamic user experience throughout the website.

To improve readability, I included **comments** throughout the code, making it easier to follow and understand the various functions and components. Admittedly, as this was my first website, the code may appear a bit unorganized or messy in some areas, particularly as I struggled to determine where to begin. Additionally, there was a delay of two months before I was able to complete the website. Despite these challenges, I am proud of the final product and the skills I acquired during the process.
